/* STATIC VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS



// By default, variables in C are local to the scope in which they are defined
// Variables can be declared as static to increase their scope to the file containing them

// Let's consider the following functions where we want to increase the value of count

int counter(){
    int count = 0;
    count++;
    return count;
}

int main(){
    printf("First call of count: %d\n", counter());
    printf("Second call of count: %d\n", counter());
    return 0;
}

// Output:
// First call of count: 1
// Second call of count: 1

// We can see that count iis not updated because it is removed from memory as soon as
// the function completes



// Now let's try using static

int counter(){
    static int count = 0;
    count++;
    return count;
}

int main(){
    printf("First call of count: %d\n", counter());
    printf("Second call of count: %d\n", counter());
    return 0;
}

// Output:
// First call of count: 1
// Second call of count: 2

// We can see that with the static keyword, the value of variables persists in memory,
// at least within the scope of the file



// STATIC FUNCTIONS

// By default, functions are global in C
// If we precede the function with the keyword static, however, its scope is
// reduced to the file containing it

// For example

static void printExample(){
    printf("This static function cannot be called from another file\n");
}

int main(){
    printExample();
    return 0;

/* MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS

    // TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS

    // The simplest form of multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array
    // A two-dimensional array is functionally a list of one-dimensional arrays

    // Declaring a two-dimensional array takes the following form:
    // type arrayName [x][y];

    // type can be any C data type (int, char, long, long long, double, etc.)
    // arrayName is an identifier
    // Number of rows is given by [x]
    // Number of columns is given by [y]

    // Thus each element in the matrix is identified by the form:
    // a[i][j]
    // Where 'a' is the name of the array, 'i' specifies the row, and 'j' specifies the column

    // In certain cases, the compiler can infer the value of [x] when provided a definition
    // For example

    char b[][5] = {
        {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'},
        {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
    }

    // However, the [y] value is still necessary, as the compiler cannot infer
    // the number of values per list


    // Let us practice initializing an array with four rows and five columns
    int x[4][5] = {
        {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, // Initializers for row indexed by 0
